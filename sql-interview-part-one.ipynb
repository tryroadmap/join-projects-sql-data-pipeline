    "Today, we're going to learn how to use SELECT, FROM and WHERE to get data from a specific column based on the value of another column. For the purposes of this explanation, we'll be using this imaginary database, `pet_records` which has just one table in it, called `pets`, which looks like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "### SELECT ... FROM\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic SQL query is to select a single column from a specific table. To do this, you need to tell SELECT which column to select and then specify what table that column is from using from. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Do you need to capitalize SELECT and FROM?** No, SQL doesn't care about capitalization. However, it's customary to capitalize your SQL commands and it makes your queries a bit easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we wanted to select the \"Name\" column from the pets table of the pet_records database (if that database were accessible as a BigQuery dataset on Kaggle , which it is not, because I made it up), we would do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT Name\n",
    "    FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets`\n",
    "\n",
    "Which would return the highlighted data from this figure.\n",

    "![](https://i.imgur.com/8FdVyFP.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### WHERE ...\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're working with BigQuery datasets, you're almost always going to want to return only certain rows, usually based on the value of a different column. You can do this using the WHERE clause, which will only return the rows where the WHERE clause evaluates to true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT Name\n",
    "    FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets`\n",
    "    WHERE Animal = \"Cat\"\n",
